print("""I have committed two sins. Therefore, whether I am arrested or executed, I shall program this message to be broadcast when my heart stops beating. I want to make one thing very clear first: to whomever may have rendered their judgment unto me, I am not trying to convince you that their intent is evil. I will not apply the labels of good and evil at all, in fact, because I understand too little about “him” to begin with. 

What I am about to tell you is so preposterous you might even burst into laughter, however, you all have the right to know:

To make a long story short, the world as we know it will sink into the sea.

Now, speaking of the near future for me, assuming that the sensors I built are functioning correctly, in the days after I record this message there should be a most remarkable earthquake that strikes the entire planet. As a result of that, the sea should rise about one meter around the world, thereby rendering some islands uninhabitable. Beaches around the world will be lost for good. If I am wrong in this prediction, feel free to disregard the rest of this message. If this has happened, however, you should heed my words very carefully! This particular earthquake is not exactly what I would call a “natural phenomenon.” 

In my own way, I only ever hoped for peace, but this was the root of my first sin. I dreamt of a source of endless, eternal energy … and in my desire to push the world forward into the future, I flew too close to the sun.

Allow me to explain just what it is that is happening to our world:

From about 900 years ago to 800 years ago — a period of a century — there is a span of history that is completely and entirely blank. We call this the “Void Century” because all records from this time were eliminated. The only means to know this piece of history is to find a message from the past in the form of Poneglyphs scattered across the world and decipher its contents. However, the World Government has made it a crime of the highest order to decipher the message of the Poneglyphs, and despite being a member of the Government itself, I broke this law. That was my second sin.

Through the sheer tenacity of a group of excellent archeologists, I inherited some texts and a number of Poneglyphs, which I have deciphered and study to the best of my ability. I regret none of this! History, you see, tells a story.

In other words, what I know is an incomplete story of that 100 year void. It would be dishonest to fill the blanks with my own speculation, so I leave you only with the verified truth: 

The main character of this story was born into a kingdom with an impossibly advanced civilzation 900 years ago. Like the Sun God Nika spoken of in Elbaf legend, he fought with a body that stretched and contracted … his name was Joyboy and he was the very first man on this sea to be called a pirate. As for why he was called a pirate, I have only read from a handful of Poneglyphs but what I found there was the record of a breathtakingly vast war. Joyboy’s enemy was the World Government of the present day. More accurately, it was the precursor to the World Government — a provisional army put together by 20 kingdoms known as The Alliance. You might say they had no other choice, so robust was Joyboy’s faction. 

Without knowing the spark that caused the war, I will not say who was right or wrong. I will simply state that two competing ideologies came head-to-head. 

As I mentioned, for its time 900 years ago, the country of Joyboy’s birth was a startingly advanced civilization. The weapons that were used over the course of this 100-year conflict appear to be impossible to re-create with the latest of modern science. Even I, a humble genius, cannot replicate them. And therein lies the problem. 

The Void Century came to a close with the defeat of Joyboy, but not before leaving vast, permanent scars of war across the face of the world. 

The world is made up of a series of islands. Sailing between them is difficult, many people never experience anything but their own culture at home. This shared understanding of the world does not necessarily apply to the world of a thousand years ago, because a cataclysm occurred during the Void Century that caused the world to sink once before.

We are currently living on the pieces of a continent that existed long ago. The world of a millennium ago now slumbers unseen at the bottom of the sea. In fact, one can assume that in the past there were a number of continents we know nothing about. If the world were still the same as it was in the past, then the act of erasing 100 years of history would be simply unthinkable and impossible. However, it makes much more sense when you understand that the rise in sea level over that century was over 200 meters. 

As for why the sea level rose so much during the Void Century, it would be natural to assume the work of a sudden natural disaster, but I can state for a fact that this was a man-made disaster! If such a cataclysm were caused by natural forces, then the initial disaster would have spanned several centuries and inflicted slow but continual damage upon the world. However, by any measurement — be it climatology, geology, environmental and atmospheric science, this dramatic shift could not have happened within a single century.  So, the cause is something else. When I detected the rise in worldwide sea levels the other day … I had my answer.

I knew the cause and confirmed its existence: the ancient weapons that sank the world into the sea 800 years ago still exist today, and await the moment that they stir once again. In other words, the vast war that arose during the Void Century never came to an end!

Sadly, I owe you all my deepest apologies. 

I will explain why: I wanted to create the energy that would power the industry of the world to come, and though it is still incomplete, I have at last reached a practical stage of my life’s work … the mother flame: a fire that never goes out. It is an energy source that will one day in the future enrich the lives of people all over the world! 

Unfortunately, one little piece of that flame has been stolen. The fault of this lies entirely with me. Around two weeks after the theft of the flame, the sky over Lulusia shone with a powerful light and the kingdom vanished without a trace, according to reports. After that was when I observed the first signs of worldwide earthquakes. As a scientist, and with utmost pride in its development, I can tell you this: nothing but the mother flame could have created so much energy. The flame that I created was used to activate an ancient weapon!

I know nothing about who might have carried this out, but the results speak for themselves. My actions have led — directly or indirectly — to the loss of many human lives. A fact that weighs upon my soul … I am so sorry! I have inadvertently proven that the man-made disaster that once sank the world is possible again! 

In the past there were three ancient weapons, and Joyboy attempted to preserve them for the future. Why would he do that for such dangerous things?! Have we not sunk far enough?! Who is the true evil here, and who fights the good fight?!

The day will come when all of the answers are laid bare, and I warn you — that moment will happen when we reach the very precipice of the world’s drowning.

The Void Century is still ripe with mystery! However, there are some who have learned the truth: The King of the Pirates’ crew. When they learned all of the true history, why did they drift apart without telling anyone? Why did they not act on it?!

I know this information is in bits and pieces, but if I were to say more it would be speculation. 

Lastly, I have one final message to impart, to those scattered throughout the world who bare the name of D — within you there is a ———————— ——— - — - ——————— - —— —— ——- ————— ——— — ————— —————— —-    ————————— —————————

That —— ————- — name —— ——- ——— ——— ——— —————— —  but actually —— ————— ———- ———- ——————— ———- ————— —————— —————— nothing of the sort, ——————- ————— ————— ———— ——————- —————- which you might consider a will inherited through the years — —— I can only pray that those at the mercy of this reason will be able to hear this message. ——————-

Someone once said that the voices of the past will be heard. History is told by the winners, and the voices of the losers at the bottom of the sea are so very faint … but this truth was gleaned at the cost of so much sacrifice. At last, this truth has been told to the world, just now.

I can only pray that this message has made it safetly out to the world at large. It would be foolish to hear about the war 900 years in the past from only one side. History requires a multifaceted approach to understand entirely. If only I had more time on my side! Alas! There are forces outside of my ability to stop.

Twenty-five years ago, the pirate Gol D. Roger completed an unprecednted tour of the entire world, and what he and his crew heard  — were likely the purest voices of the past. In conclusion, as I’m sure you’ve all surmised by now, my view of our future is thus: 

One day, the memories of the Void Century will be recalled, and mark my word: that day is coming!!

The sinking of the World’s continents was a man-made disaster brought about by the ancient weapons … weapons which, by someone’s design, still exist today! The machinations of history and fate seem to insist upon the obliteration of those last decedents of rare races.

If the worst should come to pass, I want you all to take care of yourselves. No matter what should happen, I believe in the intelligence of mankind! I believe in science!

Roger died 25 years ago, Whitebeard died two years ago, but the fall of these legends was merely the prologue of a new era!

And now these people who refuse to buckle under any and all suppression… they are the ones who are closest to the truth, ironically enough. Then again, maybe it was Roger who sent them there. The person who ends up with it may not be the one who JoyBoy desired.

There is no stopping the tide, the fate of the world now rests in the hands of the one who find it — the person who lays claim to the One Piece.

That is simply the truth: Joyboy is his ————""")
